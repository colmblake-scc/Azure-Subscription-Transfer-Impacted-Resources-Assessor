“InvalidQuery / UnknownFunction: array_join”
This repo avoids array_join by using make_set() + tostring() and does JSON parsing in PowerShell.
RBAC empty or partial
Ensure your identity has at least Reader at the chosen scope. If directory read is restricted, principalName may be blank—IDs will still be present.
ImportExcel blocked
If your environment cannot install from the gallery, install ImportExcel from an approved feed or run with -AlsoExportCsv and use CSVs instead.
